### Known Bugs

**All 3DS Models:**

* Wall-hitting sfx do not always play at right times
* Pressing home while a race is runnng may cause horses to leave map
* Glitches/crashes may occur if intentionally spamming buttons while screens are loading, but this is rare
  
**Old 3DS/Old 2DS exclusive:**
* Issues arise when racing many horses at once:
  * BGM will often stutter while gameplay appears stable, recommended to race with music off when many horses present
  * All sounds may stop playing until a horse wins
  * A horse can sometimes clip into/through walls if the fps drops enough
* **Load times may be better on new CIA version for Old3ds!**
