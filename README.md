## Current version: 1.0.0 (Main Release!)

### Current Features
* Faithful remake of Horse Race Tests, now on 3DS

* Enjoy the crisp 400x240px 3DS resolution as the arm11 struggles with all the wall collisions
### Coming Soon...
* More evil horses and more maps
* Bug fixes, expecially for old 3ds models
* More background music + menu sfx
* Auto-restart after race finishes
* Tournament mode and save data
* Intro opening animation
* green horse
### Known Bugs
**All 3DS Models:**
* Wall-hitting sfx do not always play at right times
* Pressing home while a race is runnng may cause horses to leave map
* Glitches/crashes may occur if intentionally spamming buttons while screens are loading, but this is rare
  
**Old 3DS/Old 2DS exclusive:**
* BGM will often stutter while gameplay appears stable, recommended to race with music off unless very few horses
* When many horses are present, all sounds may stop playing until a horse wins
* When many horses are present, a horse can sometimes clip into/through walls if the fps drops enough
